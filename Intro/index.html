    <h1>Intro to David Tittle</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hi, I'm Dave.</p>
    <img src="images/vault.jpg" alt="Me vaulting over a pool table like a true king." 
    <p>From this class I hope to expand my understanding of how websites work beyond what I bothered learning from Code Academy.</p>
    <p>I've been in to computers since I was a kid, taking them apart and helping my dad make 1 desktop work by stealing parts from 3 broken ones. I used to not have internet so I just spent my time rifiling through system files and settings.</p>
    <p>I will probably go for certifications or a tech  program that offers job placement at the  end of the course. If that doesn't work out I might go for a bachelors in  ComSci.</p>
    <p>I'd love to find a few ways to make relatively passive income from either an ecommerce business or some other company that I can  have other people manage once it's stable. This would allow me to enjoy more of my time instead of worrying 24/7 about retirement.</p>
    
    <p>My favorite Wiki page right now would have to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze"> Short Squeeze</a>  as one is currently happening with Gamestop stock.</p>
